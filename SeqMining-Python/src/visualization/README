Dependencies:
1. python 3.x (should be available by default in all unix/linux systems)
2. graphviz (for mac: brew install graphviz, for linux: sudo apt install graphviz)
3. plantuml.jar (I have shipped it already or download from: https://plantuml.com/starting)
4. java (should be available in mac, or download from: https://www.java.com/en/download/)
(2,3,4 are plantUML depenencies)

How to run:
If above dependency is meet, you can simply open a terminal in the visualization folder and type: python3. Then import the class as a module such in the example below:

from plantUML import Planter
#importing example

pt = Planter()
pt.start_event = [0] #specify a list of starting messages or specify the starting messages in the msg definition file
pt.end_event = [25] #specify a list of terminal messages (optional)
pt.global_depth = 5 #specify a max_height of the path (optional)
pt.msg_file = 'def.msg' #specify the msg definition file (default is large.msg), best practice is to specify the starting and terminating messages in this file by #
pt.support_file = 'supp.txt'# specify the edge support file (default is sol.txt), it is list of edge info in the form [xA_B, number], [xB_C, number], ...
pt.draw() # call draw() api to start building the graph

or import to another python script.
