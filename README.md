# AutoModel: Automatic Synthesis of Models from Communication Traces of SoC Designs

**Project Objective:**

To develop methods and algorithms for mining message flow specifications using execution traces of SoC designs.

**Project Description:** 

This repository reflects the ongoing development of the specification mining algorithm we are working on. We aim for mining a satisfactory number of rules from execution traces which will capture valid sequence of execution for any trigger. There have been many endeavors to determine correct specifications for reactive systems but none of them obliterated the need for further work in this domain. The current advancement in data mining algorithms has also got tremendous interest from specification mining researchers. Many researchers these days are working on the existing data mining algorithms to make them good alternatives to determine an efficient and reliable set of specifications for reactive systems. We also set a goal to utilize state of the art DM techniques to mine specifications in a bigger scale.   

*On-going, more updates will come soon*

**Required Installation:** 

* The program requires the installation of the Microsoft Z3 Solver, the 
NLTK toolset, networkx, joblib, and Multiple Dispatch. 

```
pip install networkx
pip install joblib
pip install nltk
pip install z3-solver
pip install multipledispatch
```
* The code base is written in Python 3.

**User Manual:** 

* *Work currently in progress, this section will be updated as more features are added to the program*

* The run script for this program is named "main.py" simply execute this script
to start the program with some command line inputs such as:

<div style="-webkit-column-count: 3; -moz-column-count: 3; column-count: 3; -webkit-column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0; -moz-column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0; column-rule: 1px dotted #e0e0e0;">
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
        <!-- first column's content -->
    </div>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
        <!-- second column's content -->
    </div>
    <div style="display: inline-block;">
        <!-- third column's content -->
    </div>
</div>

* The solver will then begin to process the information and its output will be in the output folder. Solutions generated by the z3 solver are saved in the directory path '/output/solution/<type_of_benchmark>/<size_or_model_of_benchmark>/<slicing_technique>/sol_<number>_size_<size_of_mined_model>.txt.' and the results are saved in the directory path '/output/results/<type_of_benchmark>/<size_or_model_of_benchmark>/<slicing_technique>/result_<number>_size_<size_of_mined_model>.txt.'


* The program then terminates, to re-run the program simply restart from the first step
of the user manual.
