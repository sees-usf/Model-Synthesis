# SeqMining

**Objectives:** Develop methods and algorithms to mine message flow specifications from execution traces of SoC designs. <br />
This repository reflects the ongoing development of the specification mining algorithm we are working on. We aim for mining a satisfactory number of rules from execution traces which will capture valid sequence of execution for any trigger. There have been many endeavors to determine correct specifications for reactive systems but none of them obliterated the need for further work in this domain. The current advancement in ML algorithms has also got tremendous interest from specification mining researchers. Many researchers these days are working on the existing ML algorithms to make them good alternatives to determine an efficient and reliable set of specifications for reactive systems. We also set a goal to utilize state of the art ML techniques to mine specifications in a bigger scale.
